QuPath R Extension
=======================

The **QuPath R Extension** is designed to help use QuPath and 
R together for whole slide image analysis.

It is currently intended that this will entail an R session called from QuPath,
though this is as yet unclear. It is possible if unlikely that two-way communication
will be possible.

For more information, see the [QuPath wiki](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/).

Note: This extension is unlikely to ever be anything more than experimental.
Furthermore, MATLAB may be a better choice for this task, given that it has 
a more mature QuPath extension, and that it has more extensive DSP algorithms.
